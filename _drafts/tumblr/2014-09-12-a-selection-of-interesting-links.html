<p>It&rsquo;s been too long since I had a post I could use to share a few interesting links so this post is only interesting links.</p>
<p><strong>First up some Ruby</strong></p>
<p><strong><!-- more --></strong></p>
<p>I have been building an application over the last few weeks with a greater scope than any I have done before. Following the mantra of fat model I have always aimed to move logic into the models. I not have the situation on obese models and need to break them up further.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2011-12-30-active-record-considered-harmful" title="Active Record considered harmful" target="_blank">This post</a> has a good overview of the problem and what an active record model should not do.</p>
<p>From code climate <a href="http://blog.codeclimate.com/blog/2012/10/17/7-ways-to-decompose-fat-activerecord-models/" title="7Patterns to re-factor fat active record models" target="_blank">this one</a> has some good advice on where to start breaking up these models.</p>
<p>One assertion that I have read a few times recently is that authorization logic should remain in the controller. I have followed this but as I have introduced admin and content owners and public pages this has caused my controllers to grow more than I am happy with. This is a <a href="http://ngauthier.com/2011/09/using-exceptions-to-manage-control-flow.html" title="Using exceptions to manage control flow in Rails controllers" target="_blank">good overview</a> of using exceptions to manage complexity but I would still be intrigued to read further arguments on why this logic can&rsquo;t be pushed to the controller.</p>
<p><strong>Next the Javascript</strong></p>
<p>Node Webkit. <a href="http://thejackalofjavascript.com/getting-started-with-node-webkit-apps/" title="Node Webkit – Build Desktop Apps with Node and Web Technologies" target="_blank">That sounds cool,</a> this guys<a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/building-chat-app-node-webkit-firebase-angularjs/" title="building a chat app with node-webkit, firebase and angular js" target="_blank"> blog </a>also has a whole bunch of stuff. Onsen <a href="http://components.onsenui.io/" title="Onsen Css Components" target="_blank">sounds fun </a>too. Polyfills as a service, <a href="http://labs.ft.com/2014/09/polyfills-as-a-service/" title="Polyfills as a service">why the fresh not</a>, from the financial times guys.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.mdnbar.com/javascript-common-tricks" title="JavaScript Hacks Explained" target="_blank">This article</a> is not an exciting new tech but just quite a nice overview of several JavaScript hacks.</p>
<p><strong>Python time</strong></p>
<p>I have a growing urge to program in python and<a href="http://www.toptal.com/scientific-computing/scientific-computing-with-open-source-tools" title="Scientific Computing with open source tools" target="_blank"> this post </a>is a good example of some of the stuff the python community is leading the way in. So also needed is a <a href="http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world" title="Flask Mega Tutorial" target="_blank">MEGA-tutorial</a>. Check.</p>
<p><strong>Finally I have no Idea what the bejingo</strong></p>
