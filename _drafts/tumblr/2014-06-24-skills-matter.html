<a href="https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/5233-separating-fact-from-fiction-what-do-microservices-really-look-like">Skills Matter</a><br/><p>An excellent introduction to Microservices and why to use them. I was annoyed to have missed this talk but the video is good and I hope to be getting to more of these meetups in the future. </p>
<p>For balance is this article <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2014/4/8/microservices-not-a-free-lunch.html" title="Microservices - Not a free lunch" target="_blank">Microservices - Not a free Lunch</a>. which is mentioned in the talk</p>
