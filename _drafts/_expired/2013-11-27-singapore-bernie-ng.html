<p><em>Unofficial Future Map: Singapore MRT/LRT by Bernie Ng</em></p>
<p>Submitted by Bernie, who says:</p>
<p>Hello Cameron,</p>
<p>I saw your recent post regarding future Singapore MRT/LRT maps and thought I’d throw mine into the ring. The Singapore MRT has long been one of my fave metro systems around the world. I like the concept of destination numbers and station numbers - I believe it is one of the first, if not the first, to use this concept (do let me know if that’s not quite right).  My approach for this map is to incorporate the station number into the station marker itself to avoid some of the clutter associated placing the station name AND the number alongside the station marker.  Also, I really wanted the Circle Line to be a circle, so I have adopted a few distortions to make that happen. Finally, I tried to incorporate geography of Singapore in a stylistic manner to further reinforce the circle motif.  I know this does not quite meet the professional standards I often see on this blog (this is drawn using Microsoft Visio), but let me know what you think all the same!</p>

<p>I don’t know, Bernie — this looks pretty darn nice from what I can see!</p>
<p>The temptation to make any line called the “Circle Line” live up to its name is almost always too hard to resist! Sometimes the result can be a <a href="http://transitmaps.tumblr.com/post/41737571278/orbital-underground" title="Orbital Underground">little forced or contrived</a>, but I think you’ve done a nice job here — for the most part, the stations are spaced out pretty nicely. I particularly like the way you’ve managed to keep the purple North East Line perfectly straight while heading entirely in the direction its name implies.</p>
<p>Integrating the station code <em>into</em> the station marker is a good idea that removes clutter — reader Xavier Fung pointed out that the <a href="http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/transport/trpt_dtl_sysmap.htm">new official map</a> does this as well — and the insets for the LRT systems also work well in simplifying the main map as well as providing greater detail for these services than the official map can. I also really like the stylish shell-like shape that the island of Singapore takes on: stylised but recognisable!</p>
<p>My few quibbles — the graduated grey background could be seen as representing fare zones. As Singapore uses a distance-based fare system, not a zonal one, this could cause a lot of unnecessary confusion. I also find the grey a little drab and overpowering — it seems to make the other colours used on the map a little duller as well.</p>
<p>Finally: Visio? Not my tool of choice, and you’re probably pushing it to the absolute limit of its capabilities, but this does look really, really good.</p>
<p><em>Our rating:</em> Strong visual concept, nicely executed, a couple of well-thought out innovations. Colours could be brighter and more evocative of Singapore. Three-and-a-half stars.</p>

<p>Really like the look of this map. It&rsquo;s good to see a map that focuses so determinedly on clarity. </p>
